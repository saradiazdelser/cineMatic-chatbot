# Welcome to Guardrails Demo

Welcome to our Guardrails Demo, where we showcase the basic functionalities of NeMo Guardrails. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how the guardrails technology can keep the language model (LLM) on topic, specifically answering movie-related questions.

## Technical Details

- **Model:** `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`
- **UI:** ChainLit
- **Inference:** TGI
- **Moderation:** NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails
- **Vector Store (RAG):** Qdrant DB for Rag

## Important Note

Guardrails technologies are continually refined but may still exhibit unexpected or inaccurate responses. Please bear this in mind when interacting with the system.

## Instructions

We are working with a Python 3.10 environment with the following [dependencies](./requirements.txt). For NeMo Guardrails specifically, please check their [prerequisites page](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements) before installing all our requirements (which includes NeMo Guardrails version). On the official [repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails), you can find more information on how to use Guardrails technologies.

### Launching the Demo:

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:saradiazdelser/guardrails-demo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository

    ```bash
    cd guardrails-demo
    ```

3. Launch Docker Compose
    Start Docker Compose to build and run the services defined in docker-compose.yml:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This command will build the necessary Docker images (if not already built) and start the containers for the Guardrails Demo.

4. Access the Demo
    Once Docker Compose has successfully started the services, you can access the Guardrails Demo

    - **Chatbot**: Visit <http://localhost:8000/> to interact with the deployed Guardrails Demo application.

    - **API**: To interact with the API endpoints, you can use tools like curl or Postman. Hereâ€™s a basic example using curl:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/health
    ```

5. Stopping the Demo
    To stop the services launched by Docker Compose, press Ctrl + C in the terminal where docker-compose up is running. Alternatively, run the following command in the same directory as docker-compose.yml:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

Additional Notes

- The Docker Compose setup includes configurations for the backend app, frontend interface (assuming a custom image), and Qdrant DB for Rag.

- Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine before proceeding.

Thank you for exploring our Guardrails Demo using Docker Compose. We hope you enjoy interacting with our technology!

### Accessing the Demo

Visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to interact with the deployed chatbot.

Once on the demo site, you can ask movie-related questions to see how the Guardrails keep the model focused on the specified topic.

## About Guardrails

Guardrails by NVIDIA NeMo is designed to enhance model behavior by enforcing topic-specific constraints during inference. This ensures more relevant and accurate responses in specific domains like movies.
