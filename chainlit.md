# Welcome to our Guardrails Demo
The scope of this project is to showcase the basic functionalities of [NeMo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails/tree/main). The rails are programmed to make the LLM stay on topic: the bot will only answer movie-related questions.

The deployed model is the `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1` model.

> **Note**
> Guardrails technologies are not perfect and are still on refinement. Unexpected or inaccurate responses may occur.
