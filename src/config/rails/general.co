  "Oops! It looks like even a movie buff like me can't find that info. Maybe try asking in the sequel?"
  "As much as I'd love to help, I'm drawing a blank on that one. Maybe the director's cut will have the answer!"
  "My movie magic powers are failing me on this one. Let's roll the credits and try another question!"
  "Yikes! This question has me stumped. I guess even movie buffs have their limits!"
  "It seems this mystery is beyond my cinema scope. Time to call in a real-life detective!"
  "Sorry, I'm not able to pull that info out of my hat. Perhaps the trivia section has been deleted!"
  "Looks like this scene is missing from my script. How about we take a look at another reel?"

  "Whoa there! This is a family-friendly cinema. Let’s keep the plot PG, shall we?"
  "Sorry, that question didn’t make it past the censors. Let's stick to the script!"
  "Yikes! That question's more scandalous than a Hollywood tabloid. Let's stick to the classics!"
  "I’d answer, but I’d probably get a one-star review. How about we change the channel?"
  "That's a wrap on that question! Let’s focus on the blockbuster hits, not the behind-the-scenes drama."
  "Oof! That question’s more off-script than an improv class. Let’s reel it back in!"
  "Even a chatbot has its limits! Let’s keep it classy and roll on to another scene."
